	  <p>This app is about grief and loss. It began after I lost my own dad, a few years ago, and there was no place to grieve, week after week, month after month ... It gained new life as I watched so many friends lose loved ones, over time, and then, of course, in 2020, as the number of the dead grew ever larger, hundreds of thousand above usual, from Covid and more, with no way to mourn our dead.
