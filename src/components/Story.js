			<p>My dad died in early May 2017. I spent a year mourning him, remembering his passing each morning as I walked my dog in a nearby woods, pausing near the entry to quietly chant or hum the mourner's kaddish. During that time,friends were loving and attentive, though as the weeks and months passed, it was only natural for people to stop asking how my mourning was going. It's an odd question, one that doesn't get asked much. At times I imagined other ways that a person could mourn, could let friends know what she was feeling, and how.
			</p>
			<p>Halfway through March 2020 life in the US changed. People became afraid, people got sick, people died. My neighbor John's mother died. She was 95, in assisted living. She was fine and then she wasn't and it was Covid. My neighbor George Sr. died. He was 87, and had taken ill in January. We were watching his dog Jack for him. George Sr was in the hospital and then a nursing home rehab, and back and forth a few times. He was set to return home and then in early May, he was back in the hospital, dying from Covid. They were the first in my life, and far from the last. Unlike when I was mourning my dad, it's not at all clear who we mourn people we don't know well, but whose deaths touched us. It's simply something that we don't have a clear cultural understanding of. 
			</p>
			<p>That's where this online space, Mourning, comes in. We need spaces to mourn, to grieve. Perhaps it's the chance to write out our feelings. To create a bit of an alter or remembrance site. To share with friends. Perhaps it's the chance to collect the many people -- close and far -- that meant something to us and who are no longer alive, a cemetery of our imaginations, for this moment.
