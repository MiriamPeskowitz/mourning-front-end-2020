1. general setup, following Nancy's video
2. set up root reducer 
3. entriesReducer and usersReducer: add full state, as needed in front end 
	entry (title: '', content: '')
	user(name: '') DONE, but not yet sure it works 
4. DONEBuild out the app, then think about what goes where 
5. DONE Great work on Wednesday! User actions and reducer working. Next step: build the event that fires the getUsers action to load the names on mount. 
6. DONE Then, repeat all this with the entries. 
7. Then work on number of mourners
8. DONE get rid of bullet points in entries
9. Then work on user auth. HERE now. Plan: These are the SignUp and Login pages 
React/Redux Simple Auth - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYVJcq7Ika810.  
Sprint: 
1. signup page, done. 
2. NEXT: make the data persist to backend
3. build login in page
4. build enough router so they push to new pages, home and proilfe when done.

Look at notes: 

10 Work on links and routing 
-- Doing routing first. More scared of auth

11. Semantic-ui-react -- later 

I've gotten into a mess. I have lost track of what I want the app to do. Plan: back up to user stories. 

A mourner can sign up (I really need to grab the bull by the horns and do this)

A mourner can post entries
A mourner can let her friends see the entries 

A user can see the public entries on the home page, and see the people who are mourning. 

A user can see how many people are mourning. 

Write down what should happen when each button is pressed (this will guide me on the routes)

Mourning: front page with selections of mourner and entries Plus story 

Join: SignUp

Login: Login

Story: this is the about page. 

Profile: when someone is signed in, Profile shows. 

?? What file should the routes go in?
